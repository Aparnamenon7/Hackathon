# Medical Idem

ABSTRACT

MEDICAL IDEM
The idea that we present you with is medical idem which means medical identity. A centralized system in which the medical records of entire population is safely stored,handled and added by verified hospitals and doctors making it easier to know the medical history of a particular person which in turn increases the efficiency of doctors and make it easier to diagnose  a disease. Medical idem demonstrates that hospital systems can organize and act quickly in any circumstance with the necessary details required. 

The application consists of 2 views consisting of the  client side and administrator side. In the clientside people are able to access their own medical records once their identity is created and in this view the viewer can only view their records to get the information. Any changes to a person’s medical record can be done in the administrator side which is only handled by verified hospitals and the doctors are verifies under different hospitals. In order to make changes to a person’s medical record, he or she will have to visit an hospital and have a checkup to induce changes to the record.

The most challenging part of it is the security as once leaked a person’s medical history and their life is put at stake, for which 2 factor authentication is implemented. A person can only get a verified medical idem account once they book an appointment in an hospital for which the person has to go to the hospital with certificates of each disease, vaccinations and allergies which will be verified and entered by the hospital staff and an medical id is generated and given to the person. An hospital itself may not be able to access a persons medical record but can access them only with a permission of a person who will be sent an OTP/ secret code which will be given to the authorised person in order  to access the records.
